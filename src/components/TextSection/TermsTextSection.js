                        authorization or rights to use all the content contained in their content.</p>

                        <p>Acroplia’s policy is to remove content from our service when they are reported as infringing in
                        a copyright infringement notice received from the owner of the original content. It is also our
                        policy to remove all content from any member who is determined to be a repeat infringer (for
                        whom Acroplia has received more than two valid takedown notices). We reserve the right to
                        terminate an instructor’s account at any time, including when they post content in violation of

                        <h5>1. File a report.</h5>

                        <p>If you would like to report a content on the Acroplia platform and if you are the owner or the
                        designated agent of the owner of the rights to the content that you believe the content is
                        infringing, the most efficient way is to use this <a href="https://welcome.acroplia.com/form-of-complaints/"> form</a> (form in English or Russian only).</p>

                        <p>Before you submit a copyright infringement report, please remember these important things:</p>

                        <p>-We cannot process a copyright claim that is not submitted by the owner of the copyright or its
                        designated agent, because we have no way of knowing whether the member who published the content
                        you are reporting has received proper permission from the owner to use the content.</p>

                        <p>-Knowingly submitting a false or misleading claim of infringement is illegal and you could be
                        held liable and have to pay damages as a result. Udemy reserves the right to seek damages from
                        anyone who submits a notification of claimed infringement in violation of the law.</p>

                        <p>-There are types of content that are not protected by copyright. Copyright law doesn’t cover
                        short phrases (like business names, book titles, and slogans), intangible concepts (like
                        processes, ideas, and recipes), or facts. Before you submit a copyright claim, make sure that
                        the content copied is indeed protected by copyright.</p>

                        <h5>2. Counter-Notification</h5>

                        <p>If we receive a valid copyright violation report, we will send a copy of that report to the
                        member who posted the reported content along with a notification that 1) the content was
                        reported for copyright infringement and 2) we are removing the course from the Acroplia
                        platform. We will also attach a form that the instructor can fill in and send back to us to
                        submit a counter-notification. If your content has been reported for copyright infringement and
                        removed from the Acroplia content, and if you believe we made a mistake or that you have
                        permission from the owner of the reported content to use such content, then you may send us a
                        counter-notification.</p>

                        <p>The best way to provide us with a counter-notification is to fill in the form we provided you
                        and send it back to the Acroplia designated agent or the copyright team member who notified you.
                        To be effective, a counter notification must be in writing and include the following
                        information:</p>

                        <p>-Your physical or electronic signature;</p>

                        <p>-Your name, address, and email address or telephone number,</p>

                        <p>-Identification of the content that was removed and the location (URL) at which it appeared
                        before it was removed (you can access this information from the copyright infringement report
                        filed against your content, we always attach a copy when we notify you);</p>

                        <p>-A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was
                        removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or
                        disabled; and</p>

                        <p>-A statement that you consent to (i) Acroplia sharing your name and contact information with the
                        claimant; (ii) receiving service of process for any legal action by the claimant or an agent of

                        <h3>4. Acroplia’s rights on content you post</h3>
                        <p>You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your courses. We are allowed
                        to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising on
                        other websites, but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content.</p>

                        <p>When you post comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for
                        new features or improvements, you authorize Acroplia to use and share this content with anyone,
                        distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or
                        edits to it as we see fit. In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the
                        platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to
                        sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and
                        distribute your content in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later
                        developed). This includes making your content available to other companies, organizations, or
                        individuals who partner with Acroplia for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or
                        publication of content on other media. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights,
                        power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that you submit. You also
                        agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.</p>

                        <h3>5. Using Acroplia on your own risk</h3>
                        <p>Acroplia enables anyone anywhere to create and share educational and other content in
                        communities. Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for legal issues, and
                        we are not in a position to determine the legality of any content. We do not exercise any
                        editorial control over the content that are available on the platform and, as such, do not
                        guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy or truthfulness of the content.</p>

                        <p>By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or
                        objectionable. Acroplia has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for
                        your access to such content, to the extent permissible under applicable law. This also applies
                        to any content relating to health, wellness and physical exercise. You acknowledge the inherent
                        risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of content, you choose to assume those
                        risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume
                        full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after you get the content.</p>

                        <p>When you interact directly with other members of communities, you must be careful about the
                        types of personal information that you share. We do not control what members do with the
                        information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your email or
                        other personal information about you for your safety.</p>

                        <p>When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don’t own or control.
                        We are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites, including
                        their collection of information about you. You should also read their terms and conditions and
                        privacy policies.</p>

                        <p>GXB Interactive Corporation own the Acroplia platform and Services, including the website, our
                        existing or future applications, our APIs, databases, and the content our employees or partners
                        submit or provide through our Services (but excluding content provided by users of Acroplia in
                        their communities) are and will remain the exclusive property of GXB Interactive Corporation and
                        its licensors. Copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign
                        countries protect our platforms and services. Nothing gives you a right to use the Acroplia and
                        GXB Interactive Corporation name or any of our trademarks, logos, domain names, and other
                        distinctive brand features. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding
                        Acroplia or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback,
                        comments, or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.</p>

                        <p>You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Acroplia platform and Services:</p>

                        <p>-access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the platform, Acroplia’s computer systems, or
                        the technical delivery systems of Acroplia’s service providers.</p>

                        <p>-disable, interfere with, or try to circumvent any of the features of the platforms related to
                        security or probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any of our systems.</p>

                        <p>-copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, or otherwise
                        attempt to discover any source code of or content on the Acroplia platform or Services.</p>

                        <p>–access or search or attempt to access or search our platform by any means (automated or
                        otherwise) other than through our currently available search functionalities that are provided
                        via our website, mobile apps, or API (and only pursuant to those API terms and conditions). You
                        may not scrape, spider, use a robot, or use other automated means of any kind to access the
                        Services.</p>

                        <p>–in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information
                        (such as sending email communications falsely appearing as Acroplia); or interfere with, or
                        disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host, or network, including, without
                        limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the platforms or
                        services, or in any other manner interfering with or creating an undue burden on the Services.</p>

                        <a className="scroll-target"  name="terms"></a>
                        <h3>7. Legal terms</h3>
                        <p>You agree that by registering, accessing or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter into a
                        legally binding contract with GXB Interactive Corporation. If you do not agree to these Terms,
                        do not register, access, or otherwise use any of our Services. These Terms (including any
                        agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and
                        us.</p>

                        <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then that
                        provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches
                        the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.</p>

                        <p className="font-weight-bold">You accept that the Services and their content are provided on an “as is” and “as available”
                        basis. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or
                        warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of
                        errors, or accuracy of the Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or
                        conditions (express or implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
                        particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners,
                        and agents) make no warranty that you will obtain specific results from use of the Services.
                        Your use of the Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some
                        jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions
                        may not apply to you.</p>

                        <p>We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and for any
                        reason. Under no circumstances will GXB Interactive Corporation or its affiliates, suppliers,
                        partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of
                        availability of such features.</p>

                        <p>We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused by
                        events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural
                        disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.</p>

                        <p>We (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any
                        indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue,
                        profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract,
                        warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the
                        possibility of damages in advance. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion or limitation of
                        liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>

                        <p>Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you
                        understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict. These
                        Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA without reference to its choice
                        or conflicts of law principles. Where the “legal terms” section below does not apply, you and we
                        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of federal and state courts in San Francisco,
                        California, USA.</p>

                        <p>If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If that doesn’t work
                        and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court or
                        bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or
                        participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.</p>

                        <p>We may sometimes make changes to these terms and policies. If we make material changes that
                        adversely affect your rights, then we will let you know before the changes come into effect.
                        Continuing to use Acroplia after a change means you accept the new terms or policies.</p>

                        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or disputes regarding our Terms of Use, please feel free to
                        contact our legal team at <a href="mailto:legal@gxbventures.com"> legal@gxbventures.com.</a> or write to us at GXB Interactive Corporation,
