                        participate, we will collect and store the data you provide as part of participating, such as
                        your name, email address, date of birth, or phone number. That data is subject to this Privacy

                        visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding
                        current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new mobile app

                        your rights under CCPA. To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email <a
