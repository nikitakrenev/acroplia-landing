                        <p>Acroplia is a unique community, which can connect people from every country in the Earth with
                            different religious, ideology, legislation. That’s why so important to create common
                            behavior rules to save the peace in our world of Acroplia.</p>


                        <p>These Community Guidelines ensure that all conversations taking place every day in Acroplia will
                        help our members be more productive and successful, and are free of inappropriate and unwanted
                        content or behavior. We ask every Guest and Member on Acroplia to act responsibly. If you see
                        something that you believe may violate our policies, please report it to us by emailing
                        <a href="mailto:legal@gxbventures.com"> legal@gxbventures.com.</a> This includes whether it appears in accounts, posts, comments,
                            conversations, or anywhere else.</p>


                        <p>A violation of these policies may result in us taking enforcement actions. Depending on the
                        severity of the violation and a member’s behavior or account history, we may limit the
                        visibility of certain content, remove content from our platform, or even restrict or delete a
                        member’s account in the event of severe or repeated offenses.</p>


                        <p>There are the principles that are the basis of the Acroplia’s work:</p>


                        <h3>1. Authenticity</h3>


                        <p>We want to make sure the content people are seeing on Acroplia is authentic. You can’t create
                        fake pages or collect money for things you’re not actually doing. You cannot pretend to be or
                        impersonate someone else by using the name, brand or works of another to deceive patrons. You
                        also can’t use Acroplia as a prank or to fund non-activity.</p>


                        <h3>2. Privacy</h3>


                        <p>We are committed to protecting personal privacy and information. Privacy gives people the
                        freedom to be themselves, and to choose how and when to share on Acroplia and to connect more
                            easily. You can read more about collecting your information on Acroplia in our Privacy Policy.</p>


                        <h3>3. Equality</h3>


                        <p>We believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect
                        the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others. Our Community Guidelines apply to
                        everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content. They’re designed to be
                        comprehensive – for example, content that might not be considered hateful may still be removed
                            for violating a different policy.</p>


                        <p>We can remove any content for following behavior:</p>


                        <h3>4. Bullying and harassment</h3>


                        <p>We don’t allow bullying or harassment that targets individuals or groups to degrade or shame.
                        This includes abusive language, sexual advances and innuendo, revealing others’ personal or
                        sensitive information (aka “doxing”), posting content about them without consent, or inciting or
                            engaging others to do any of the same.</p>


                        <h3>5. Hate</h3>


                        <p>We don’t allow content that denigrates, intimidates, or incites or threatens hatred, violence,
                        or prejudicial action against individuals or groups because of their actual or perceived race,
                        ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation,
                        or mental, medical, or physical condition. Hate groups are not welcome and not permitted on the
                            services.</p>


                        <h3>6. Violence</h3>


                        <p>We don’t allow any threat of violence against an individual or a group on our platform. This
                        includes statements of an intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm. We don’t allow
                        individuals or groups that engage in or promote violence, property damage, or organized criminal
                        activity. You may not use our services to express support for such individuals or groups or to
                            post content or otherwise use the services to incite or glorify violence.</p>


                        <h3>7. Terrorism</h3>


                        <p>We don’t allow any terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups on our platform. And we
                        don’t allow any individuals who affiliate with such organizations or groups to promote their
                        activities. Content that depicts terrorist activity, that is intended to recruit for terrorist
                        organizations, or threatens, promotes, or supports terrorism in any manner is not tolerated on
                        the services.</p>


                        <h3>8. Harmful content and shocking material</h3>


                        <p>We don’t allow graphic or other content intended to shock or humiliate others. We don’t allow
                        activities that promote, organize, depict, or facilitate criminal activity. We also don’t allow
                        content depicting or promoting instructional weapon making, drug abuse, and threats of theft.
                        Content or activities that promote or encourage suicide or any type of self-injury, including
                        self-mutilation and eating disorders, is also not allowed. If you see signs that someone may be
                        considering self-harm, please report it.</p>


                        <h3>9. Spam and scams</h3>


                        <p>We do not allow untargeted, irrelevant, obviously unwanted, unauthorized, inappropriately
                        commercial or promotional, or gratuitously repetitive messages or other similar content. Do not
                        use our invitation feature to send promotional messages to people you don’t know or to otherwise
                        spam people. Please make the effort to create original, professional, relevant, and interesting
                        content in order to gain popularity, instead of trying ways to artificially increase the number
                        of views, re-shares, likes, or comments.</p>


                        <h3>10. Pornographic</h3>


                        <p>We don’t allow pornographic material or sexual services on Acroplia, which we define as “real
                        people engaging in sexual acts such as masturbation or sexual intercourse on camera.” You should
                        never post or share nude creations of any individual under the age of 18, including yourself. As
                        a strong commitment to child safety, we will work with law enforcement whenever we come across
                            child exploitation material.</p>


                        <h3>11. Doxing</h3>


                        <p>We take a strong stance against doxing, which is sharing an individual’s private information or
                        aggregating their public information for the purpose of intimidating them through harassment. No
                        matter the specific information shared, we also evaluate the context around why it was shared.
                        If it looks like this information is being shared for the purpose of making it easier for a
                        large group to harass that individual, we are likely to consider it doxing.</p>


                        <p>We respect all users on Acroplia and hope, that our users will respect each other. We hope that
                        all above behavior will not appear in accounts, posts, comments, conversations, or anywhere
                        else. Or otherwise we will have to take measures to save peace on Acroplia.</p>


                        <p>Depending on the severity of the violation and a member’s behavior or account history, we may:</p>


                        <p>– limit the visibility of certain content,</p>

                        <p>– remove content from our platform,</p>

                        <p>– restrict or delete a member’s account in the event of severe or repeated offenses.</p>


                        <p>These Guidelines are the part of Acroplia’s Terms of Use. For more information, contact us at
